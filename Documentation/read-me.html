<!-- 2 Product Development Cycle -->
<!-- ===================================================================================-->
			<h1 id="s2"><span>2</span>Product Dev Cycle</h1>
		<p>After review of the requirements for this project it was agreed upon collectively that we would come up with an Application
			that was something that we would use, or was needed.  We wanted to create a product that could be viable to be
			built out longer term.  There are bike rental Ford and Jump(Uber owned)companies, motorized scooter companies, Lyft, Uber, but there are
			no Scooter companies, Kick Scooters that is!  And ScootWee was born!  A kickscooter rental service for the urban jungle!</p>
		<p>So, we began our Psuedo coding, laying out our steps, db, we would take to meet MVP for approval by the powers (Justin).</p>
		<p>A kickscooter rental service for the City at high density areas of mass transit for those who are not comfortable with the bike
			lanes and traffic and can be safe on sidewalks! A simple $5 a day fee, log in, see where there are scooters near you, reserve,
			pay and pick it up!  Goals to work with major companies like Razor, Micro, Xooter.  And try to work with Ford in a joint share of space.</p>
